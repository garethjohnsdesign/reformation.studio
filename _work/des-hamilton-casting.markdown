quotes:
- text: This is a sensitive observation of what it was like growing up in the troubles,
    or being a part of them. It captures the regrets and the fears of thoughtful people,
    to this day. The concerns for the future are powerful. It deserves a wide audience
  cite: Alastair Stewart OBE, ITV News
- text: If there was ever a film that should be watched to show the reality of growing
    up in Northern Ireland, this is it. No frills, no sanitisation, but rather honesty
    and reality nestled between characteristic Northern grit, humour and sadness.
    An emotional watch, but an important one. Born and Reared will answer some questions,
    but it will also more importantly leave you soul searching for personal and collective
    solutions. A must watch.
  cite: Máiría Cahill, Senator, Seanad Éireann
