  description: "London-born filmmaker Henrietta Norton honed her craft originally
    in the arts; working with clients including the British Council, The Arts Council
    and independent production companies such as Artichoke and motiroti.\n\nStarting
    her film work with commercial doc-style films for clients like Youtube and the
    BBC Worldwide, she went on to make docs about communities in the US, Greece and,
    with her feature, Northern Ireland. \n\nShe is drawn to exploring and investigating
    the more complex aspects of contemporary themes, like migration and identity and
    has an innate ability to build trust with contributors and subjects quickly and
    genuinely. \n\nA previous Producer said of her; “You can drop her in anywhere,
    for any amount of time, and she’ll find and tell the most interesting story there.”"
